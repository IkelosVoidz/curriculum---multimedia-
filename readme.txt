Project Analysis

	1- Final user : The final user will be a job recruiter, therefore we want the resumee to only be one page long and
	have its most important information displayed clearly and concisely, so that the recruiter doesnt have to take long to understand who we are and what are our skills
	2- Visual design 

		- I have chosen to have a blue palette for this project, blue is a calm color, one that transmits security and confidence
		  which is exactly what we want to transmit with a resume
		
		- I have chosen to use "Calibri" font, its a round-ish font that is very pleasant to the eyes and looks very professional.
		
		- I will divide the resumee in two sides, a left sidebar that will contain my personal information as well as my programming skills and my language knowledge
		  and a right content side that will contain my past job experience in detail and my education
